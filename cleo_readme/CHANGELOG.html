<h3 id="updates-to-behaviour-of-following-opcodes-">Updates to behaviour of following opcodes:</h3>
<h4 id="0a99">0A99</h4>
<p>CHANGE_DIRECTORY can now correctly change to the program directory</p>
<h4 id="0a9a">0A9A</h4>
<p>OPEN_FILE now uses a &#39;legacy&#39; mode when passing an integer as the mode parameter for compatibility of CLEO file handles and SA file handles
Note that you should really not pass CLEO file handles to game functions. However, this legacy mode now ensures that the handles are compatible.
Other file functions have also been updated ensuring that game file handles are passed to relevant game functions.
It is recommended to not rely on passing files to game functions and instead use CLEO 4&#39;s in-built file functions in future.</p>
<h4 id="0ad1">0AD1</h4>
<p>CALL now accepts string input, which is passed as a string pointer following string convention</p>
<h4 id="0ad4">0AD4</h4>
